Library-Database-Tutorial
=========================

Front-end framework for a screenshot-based tutorial with multiple-choice questions. Designed for use with bibliographic databases, but could be used for most anything.

REQUIRES JQUERY

This is a CSS/jQuery framework for a tutorial I originally built for the Simmons OneView marketing database.

It's a two-panel design. In the left panel, text or multiple choice questions appear. In the right, an image of your choice.

When a question is answered, you can provide a response that will show in the left panel, and/or a new "slide" to show in the right.
